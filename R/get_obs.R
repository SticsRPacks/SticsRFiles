#' Read STICS observation files (*.obs)
#'
#' @description Read STICS observation files from a JavaSTICS workspace and
#' store data into a list per usm
#'
#' @param workspace Vector of path(s) of directory(ies) containing the STICS
#' observation files to read (*.obs file) or path of a single directory
#' containing one sub-folder per USM (named as the USM names),
#' each of them containing the corresponding files to read.
#' In the second case, the argument `usm` must also be provided.
#' @param usm Vector of USM names. Optional, if not provided, the function
#' returns the results for all USMs.
#' @param var Vector of variable names for which results have to be provided.
#' Optional, all variables considered by default. See `get_var_info()`
#' to get the list of STICS variables names.
#' @param dates list of dates to filter (POSIX date)
#' @param usms_file Path of a USM xml file. Optional, if provided, the plant
#' names are added in the Plant column (see details).
#' @param javastics Path of JavaSTICS. Optional, should be provided in addition
#' to usms_file to get the plant codes if the plant files used are not
#' in the workspace but in the JavaSTICS distribution (see Details).
#' @param verbose Logical value for displaying or not information while running
#'
#' @details **The `.obs` files names must match USMs names**, *e.g.* for a usm
#' called "banana", the `.obs` file should be named `banana.obs`.
#' For intercrops, the name should be suffixed by "p" for the principal
#' and "a" for the associated plant.
#'
#' If `usm` is not specified (or equal to `NULL`), the
#' function reads the files from all usms in the `workspace`(s).
#'
#' If `usms_file` is provided and if the associated plant file is found,
#' the plant names in the "Plant" column of the generated `data.frame`
#' are either the plant code (as specified in the plant file) or
#' the name of the plant file, if the plant file is not found.
#'
#' If `usms_file` is not specified, the plants are named "plant_1"
#' by default (+ "plant_2" for intercrops).
#'
#' @return A list, where each element is a `data.frame` of observations
#' for the given usm. The list is named after the USM name.
#'
#' Intercrops are returned in a single `data.frame`, and are identified
#' using either the "Plant" or "Dominance" columns.
#'
#' See Details section for more information about the "Plant" column.
