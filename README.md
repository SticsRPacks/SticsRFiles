The goal of SticsRFiles is to perform manipulations of the
[STICS](https://eng-stics.paca.hub.inrae.fr/) model files either on XML
files (used by the JavaSTICS GUI) or on text files used by the model
fortran executable.

The basic functionalities allows to read parameters names and values
through XML queries and replace parameters values in files. A starting
guide is available on the [Get started
page](https://sticsrpacks.github.io/SticsRFiles/articles/SticsRFiles.html).

Advanced functionalities are dedicated to produce XML parameter files
using a mailing process like from XML templates and Excel sheets
containing multiple simulations contexts. A JavaSTICS workspace is
generated and directly usable from the JavaSTICS interface (GUI or
command line), or with an R JavaSTICS interface provided by the
[SticsOnR](https://sticsrpacks.github.io/SticsOnR/) package.

## Installation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

***Warning:*** *If during the installation process, packages updates are
suggested.*

- First, abort the installation.

### Recommended installation: `SticsRPacks`

The best way to install the packages from `SticsRPacks`, from which
`SticsRFiles` is part of, is by installing the `[SticsRPacks]` package.
The package can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/) using
either the `devtools` package, or the more lightweight the `remotes`
package:

- With `devtools`

``` r
      devtools::install_github("SticsRPacks/SticsRPacks")
```

- With `remotes`

``` r
      remotes::install_github("SticsRPacks/SticsRPacks")
```

The package will install the packages for you at the latest release
version.

### Direct installation from the CRAN or [GitHub](https://github.com/)

- From the CRAN

``` r
      install.packages("SticsRFiles")
```

- From GitHub

``` r
      devtools::install_github("SticsRPacks/SticsRFiles@*release")

      or 
      
      remotes::install_github("SticsRPacks/SticsRFiles@*release")
```

Normally, all the package dependencies will be installed for CRAN
packages.

## Examples

### Files manipulations

- A description of how to use the functions for manipulating XML input
  files is detailed
  [here](https://sticsrpacks.github.io/SticsRFiles/articles/Manipulating_Stics_XML_files.html)

- A description of how to use the functions for manipulating text input
  files is available
